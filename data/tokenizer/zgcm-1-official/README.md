## Introduction

**ZGCM-1** is a **7.39B-parameter dense language model trained from scratch**, built for mathematical reasoning and tool-assisted search. It combines deliberate internal thinking with active information gathering, supporting **256K-token context** and both thinking and direct-response modes in a single model.

The project brings together an efficient hybrid-attention architecture, FP8 training with Muon, progressive long-context mid-training, and general-agentic supervised fine-tuning. Researcher-directed AI agents contribute throughout development, from data curation and cluster operations to evaluation and deployment.

## Highlights

- **Math and reasoning at 7B scale.** ZGCM-1 achieves 97.13% on MATH-500, 75.00% on AIME 2026, and 70.42% on HMMT 2025, with the best average rank across the report's 14 reasoning benchmarks among the seven compared 7B–8B models.
- **Search beyond model memory.** Multi-step tool use reaches 63.09% on WebWalkerQA, 19.43% on BrowseComp, and 62.00% on Binary Function Search.
- **Efficient long context.** Gated sliding-window and global attention deliver 3.94× training throughput at 256K compared with full attention in the report's architecture experiments. The report estimates an approximately 4.2× improvement in 16K pretraining time-to-loss from combined architecture, precision, optimizer, and normalization gains.
- **An open research recipe.** The [training repository](https://github.com/zgcagi/ZGCM-1) releases the data-processing, pretraining, mid-training, and SFT workflows, with stage-specific configurations and runtime documentation.

## Quickstart

ZGCM-1 ships its own modeling code, so `trust_remote_code=True` is required.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "zgcagi/ZGCM-1-7B"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    dtype="bfloat16",
    device_map="auto",
)

messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Compute 1+1."}]
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    enable_thinking=True,
)
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_new_tokens=4096,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=1.0,
    top_p=1.0,
)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Evaluation Results

The following results are from the technical report, using the **256K SFT checkpoint in thinking mode**. Non-agentic evaluations use temperature 1.0, top-p 1.0, and mean pass@1 over 32 runs unless otherwise specified.

### Agentic search

| Benchmark | ZGCM-1 (%) | Setting |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| WebWalkerQA | 63.09 | Web search and page reading |
| BrowseComp | 19.43 | Web search and page reading |
| GAIA (text-only) | 42.52 | Web search and page reading |
| Binary Function Search | 62.00 | 31/50 exact function-entry matches using Ghidra tools |

*Source: Tables 3–4. Web research allows up to 64 search-and-read steps. Binary Function Search uses a separate protocol on 50 tasks from 10 held-out projects.*

## Architecture and Training

![ZGCM-1 hybrid attention architecture with gated sliding-window GQA and global attention](assets/zgcm-1-architecture.png)


| Model specification | ZGCM-1 |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture | Decoder-only dense Transformer |
| Parameters | 7.39B |
| Layers / hidden size | 32 / 4,096 |
| Attention | 27 gated sliding-window layers + 5 global layers |
| Local window / GQA heads | 128 tokens / 32 query heads, 8 KV heads |
| Maximum context | 262,144 tokens (256K) |

The training recipe described in the report has three main stages:

1. **Pretraining:** approximately 4.19T tokens, combining curriculum-based data mixing with hybrid FP8 precision and Muon optimization.
2. **Mid-training:** approximately 600B tokens with context extended from **16K → 64K → 256K**. Interaction traces are reformulated as Markov Decision Process (MDP) state-action transitions to supervise individual decisions.
3. **Supervised fine-tuning:** joint general and agentic training with mixed thinking/direct-response examples, execution-verified trajectories, and assistant-only loss. The report also explores mixed RL for mathematics and code.
